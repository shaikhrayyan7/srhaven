    <h2>About This App</h2>
    <p>
      This app was developed by <b>Mohd Rayyan Shaikh</b> and <b>Ayesha Dhool</b> as part of the <b>Specialization Course: Developing Mobile Applications.</b> The project was completed under the guidance and supervision of <b>Professor Peter Dillinger.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The app was developed between November - December 2024 as a part of our academic endeavor to create a user-friendly travel diary platform. It aims to help users track their travel experiences, document memories, and explore destinations with an interactive map interface.

      We hope this app enhances your journey by allowing you to easily store and relive your travel memories, while providing a seamless experience to track your past adventures.
